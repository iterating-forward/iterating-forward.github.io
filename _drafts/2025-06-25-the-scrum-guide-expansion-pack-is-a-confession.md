**Summary**: Jeff Sutherland releases the "Scrum Guide Expansion Pack" - not a new version, but a supplement. It adds AI as an "actor" and introduces "Product Developers." What does this say about Scrum's direction?

**Tech Context (Jun 2025)**: June 11, 2025 - Scrum Guide Expansion Pack published. Introduces AI as actor, "Supporters" role, renames Developers to "Product Developers." Heavy focus on Cynefin and complexity.

When the creators of Scrum feel the need to "expand" their 13-page guide, it's worth asking: what problem are they solving?

## The Key Changes

1. **AI as an Actor**: Official recognition that AI tools are participants in development work
2. **Supporters**: People who help the team but aren't on the team
3. **Product Developers**: More than a name change - broader accountability for the whole product lifecycle

## What This Actually Means

[Content to be developed]

The Expansion Pack is Sutherland acknowledging what practitioners have known for years: the Scrum Guide is too short to actually implement Scrum.

The addition of "Supporters" legitimizes the reality that Scrum Teams don't operate in isolation.

The AI actor recognition is both forward-thinking and a tacit admission that the nature of "development work" has fundamentally changed.

## The Contrarian Take

The most interesting addition isn't AI - it's "Supporters." Finally, official acknowledgment that teams need help from people who aren't on the team.
