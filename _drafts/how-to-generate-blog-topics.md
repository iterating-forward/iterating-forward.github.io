# SEU Blog Topic Ideas (PRIVATE - NOT PUBLISHED)

## Writing Style Guide (from HN Top Bloggers Research)

**What works** (based on Sean Goedecke, Simon Willison, Jeff Geerling):

1. **Take a clear, opinionated stance** - especially on topics many disagree with
2. **Use provocative but honest titles** - pose questions or make claims
3. **Structure: Hook → Puzzle → Argument → Reversal → Conclusion**
4. **Length: 1,000-1,800 words** - focused, not sprawling
5. **Defend practitioners from critics** - explain systemic causes, not blame individuals
6. **Flip conventional assumptions** - show why the "obvious" view is wrong
7. **Ground abstract ideas in concrete stakes** - what does this mean for your career?

**Tone**: Conversational, analytical, slightly cynical but ultimately constructive

**Avoid**: Preachy, generic advice, "5 tips" listicles (unless genuinely useful)

## High-Impact Topics (Opinionated, Contrarian)

### Organizational Dynamics (Sean Goedecke style)
- [ ] Why good Scrum Masters write bad user stories at big companies
- [ ] Nobody actually knows how your sprint planning works
- [ ] Agile coaches should be a little bit cynical
- [ ] The deliberate tradeoff: Why companies choose bad Scrum
- [ ] Why your "self-organizing" team isn't (and that's fine)
- [ ] The Scrum Master as a political role, not a process role

### Defending Practitioners
- [ ] Why sprints fail: It's not the team's fault
- [ ] In defence of the reluctant Scrum Master
- [ ] The myth of the "bad Product Owner"
- [ ] Why engineers hate Agile (and why they're half-right)

### Flipping Assumptions
- [ ] Story points aren't estimates (and that's the point)
- [ ] The daily standup is not a status meeting (but maybe it should be)
- [ ] Why "waterfall" companies are often more agile than "Agile" ones
- [ ] Technical debt isn't bad code - it's a business decision
- [ ] The Scrum Guide is too short (a controversial reading)

---

## Experience-Based Posts (Your Real Stories)

### Honest Retrospectives
- [ ] A sprint that went wrong (and what we actually learned)
- [ ] When we abandoned story points: What happened next
- [ ] The meeting that changed how we do retros
- [ ] Why I stopped being a Scrum purist

### Systemic Observations
- [ ] How turnover destroys Agile teams (and what you can't do about it)
- [ ] The Agile transformation that failed (a post-mortem)
- [ ] When Scrum ceremonies become cargo cult
- [ ] Why your retrospective actions never get done

---

## Technical Agile (For Engineers)

- [ ] CI/CD is the real Agile transformation
- [ ] Definition of Done for infrastructure work
- [ ] Why test automation matters more than Scrum
- [ ] The tension between "working software" and "clean code"
- [ ] Trunk-based development: The Agile practice nobody talks about

---

## AI & Agile (Timely)

- [ ] Using AI to write user stories: Early experiments
- [ ] Will AI replace the Scrum Master? (A serious analysis)
- [ ] Agile for AI projects: What actually works
- [ ] The sprint that was 90% AI-generated code

---

## Link Curation Posts (Simon Willison style - low effort, high value)

Format: Find interesting Agile content, add your commentary

- [ ] Interesting Scrum article + "Here's why this matters..."
- [ ] Conference talk summary + your take
- [ ] New Scrum Guide interpretation you disagree with
- [ ] Tool review with honest assessment

## Post Template

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "[Provocative claim or question]"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [agile/scrum/teams/leadership]
---

[Hook: Acknowledge a common observation or frustration]

[Puzzle: But wait - how does this happen? Why does it persist?]

[Root cause: The systemic/structural explanation]

[Reversal: Flip the conventional assumption]

[Stakes: What this means for practitioners]

[Conclusion: Defend/empower the reader]
```

## Notes

- **Target: 1,000-1,500 words** (more focused than before)
- **Be opinionated** - "clear opinion many disagree with" performs best
- **Defend engineers/practitioners** - explain systems, don't blame people
- **One solid post = ~2 SEUs** (research + writing + editing)

**Renewal needs**:
- CSM/CSPO: 20 SEUs = ~10 posts
- A-CSM/A-CSPO: 30 SEUs = ~15 posts
- CSP-SM/CSP-PO: 40 SEUs = ~20 posts
