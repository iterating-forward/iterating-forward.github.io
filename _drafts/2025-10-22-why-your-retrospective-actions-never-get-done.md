title: "Why Your Retrospective Actions Never Get Done"

**Summary**: After months of watching teams generate retro action items that never happen, it's time to admit the systemic reasons why.

**Tech Context (Oct 2025)**: Amazon announces largest-ever layoff round (14,000 corporate roles). Teams under pressure deprioritize improvement work. Gartner reports on platform engineering reducing cognitive load.

I audited a team's last 12 retrospectives. They had 47 action items. They completed 3.

## The Systemic Problem

Retrospective action items don't get done because they compete with sprint work, and sprint work always wins.

The system is designed for delivery, not improvement.

If your team can't allocate capacity for improvement work without falling behind on commitments, that's not a discipline problem - it's a capacity problem.

And capacity is set by people who don't attend your retrospectives.

## Why This Keeps Happening

[Content to be developed]

- Improvement work isn't "real work" to stakeholders
- Velocity pressure crowds out everything else
- No one owns the improvement backlog

## The Contrarian Take

Stop putting action items in your backlog. Put them in your Sprint Goal. Or accept they won't happen.
