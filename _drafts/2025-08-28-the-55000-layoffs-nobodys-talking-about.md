**Summary**: Mid-2025 data shows 55,000 layoffs directly attributed to AI. But the real story isn't the number - it's who's getting cut and why.

**Tech Context (Aug 2025)**: Challenger Gray & Christmas reports 55,000 AI-attributed layoffs in 2025. 40% of Microsoft developer layoffs. IBM CEO says it's "overhiring correction," not AI. 55% of employers regret AI layoffs.

If AI is so good at coding, why are the layoffs hitting QA, support, and middle management harder than developers?

## The Narrative vs. Reality

The "AI layoffs" narrative is convenient cover for workforce reduction that companies wanted to do anyway.

The IBM CEO admitted it: this is an overhiring correction from 2020-2023. AI is the excuse, not the cause.

Meanwhile, the actual developers using AI tools are more productive and more valuable than ever.

## What the Data Shows

[Content to be developed]

- 55,000 "AI layoffs" = less than 1% of total job losses
- 55% of employers regret AI-related layoffs
- Companies cutting entry-level while complaining about skill gaps

## The Contrarian Take

The people being laid off "for AI" are mostly not being replaced by AI. They're just not being replaced.
