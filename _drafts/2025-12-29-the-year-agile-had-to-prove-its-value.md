This was the year you couldn't hide behind process anymore.

## What 2025 Demanded

2025 stripped away the ceremonial aspects of Agile and demanded outcomes.

The organizations that survived did so by returning to first principles:
- Deliver working software
- Get feedback
- Iterate

The frameworks, certifications, and rituals matter less than ever.

## What Actually Mattered

[Content to be developed]

What matters is: does your team ship, and does what you ship create value?

- Teams that delivered: thrived
- Teams that had good process but slow delivery: questioned
- Agile-in-name-only: exposed

## The Contrarian Take

The "death of Agile" predictions were wrong. What died was the Agile Industrial Complex - the consultants, frameworks, and certifications that added process without adding value.
