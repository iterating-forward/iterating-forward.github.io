**Summary**: Amazon, Dell, and AT&T announce full return-to-office mandates. This isn't just an HR story - it's fundamentally about trust, and Scrum's self-organizing teams are the canary in the coal mine.

**Tech Context (Feb 2025)**: Amazon's 5-day RTO mandate takes effect. Dell announces March RTO. Federal workers ordered back to office. 1 in 4 C-suite executives admit RTO policies were designed to encourage voluntary turnover.

Your daily standup just got harder. Not because of the work - because half your team is now commuting 3 hours a day.

## The Trust Problem

RTO mandates are a symptom of organizations that never trusted self-organizing teams in the first place. If you need to see butts in seats to believe work is happening, you never believed in Scrum.

The companies forcing RTO are the same ones where "Agile transformation" meant renaming meetings.

## What This Reveals

[Content to be developed]

- Organizations that tracked presence, not outcomes
- "Self-organizing" teams that weren't allowed to self-organize
- The gap between Agile values and corporate control

## The Contrarian Take

The real Agile companies? They're staying remote - because they actually measure outcomes, not attendance.
