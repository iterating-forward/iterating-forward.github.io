**Summary**: Developer sentiment toward Agile hits new lows as AI coding tools reveal what developers actually want: flow state, not ceremonies.

**Tech Context (Apr 2025)**: 84% of developers now using AI coding tools. Developer surveys show increasing AI adoption but also increasing ceremony fatigue. Web Summit Rio focuses on AI and developer productivity.

I've yet to meet a developer who says, "You know what I love? Sprint planning."

## The Real Problem

Developers don't hate Agile - they hate fake Agile. The version where they:

- Estimate tickets they didn't write
- Attend retrospectives that change nothing
- Get interrupted every 2 hours for a "quick sync"

Real Agile should increase flow time, not fragment it. If your implementation of Scrum makes coding harder, you're doing it wrong.

## What Developers Actually Want

[Content to be developed]

- Uninterrupted time to think
- Context on *why*, not just *what*
- Trust that they'll deliver

## The Contrarian Take

The best engineering teams I've seen have fewer Scrum ceremonies, not more. They've earned the right through trust and delivery.
