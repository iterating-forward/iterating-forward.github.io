Every Scrum Master I know is asking the same question: "Am I next?"

## What AI Actually Replaces

AI isn't replacing facilitation, coaching, or organizational change - it's replacing middle management. The irony: the roles most threatened are the ones that never let Scrum Masters actually do their jobs.

The layers of approval, the status meetings, the project managers tracking velocity - those are the roles AI eats first.

## The Real Threat

[Content to be developed]

- Status reporting automated
- Simple project tracking automated
- Complex human dynamics? Not automated.

## The Contrarian Take

If your value as a Scrum Master was "running meetings" and "updating Jira," you were already replaceable. By a spreadsheet.
