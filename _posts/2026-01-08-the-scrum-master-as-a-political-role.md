**Summary**: After a year of layoffs, AI disruption, and organizational change, it's clear that the successful Scrum Masters weren't the best facilitators - they were the best navigators of organizational politics.

**Tech Context (Jan 2026)**: Predictions for 2026 focus on AI agents joining workforce. Platform engineering merging with AI. Teams preparing for continued disruption.

Nobody told you in CSM training that your job is 80% organizational politics.

## The Unspoken Reality

The Scrum Guide describes a Scrum Master as someone who:
- Removes impediments
- Coaches the team
- Serves the organization

It doesn't mention that most impediments are political:
- Budgets
- Org structure
- Executive priorities
- Inter-team dependencies

## Who Survived 2025

[Content to be developed]

The Scrum Masters who survived 2025 weren't the ones who ran the best retrospectives - they were the ones who knew how to:
- Influence without authority
- Navigate reorgs
- Protect their teams from organizational chaos

## The Contrarian Take

If you're a Scrum Master and you're not spending significant time understanding your organization's political landscape, you're not doing your job.
