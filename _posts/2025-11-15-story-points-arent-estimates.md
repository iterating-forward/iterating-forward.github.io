title: "Story Points Aren't Estimates (And That's The Point)"

**Summary**: As AI accelerates development velocity, the story point debate resurfaces. Teams are asking if estimation still matters when AI can just... do the work.

**Tech Context (Nov 2025)**: GitHub Copilot surpasses 20 million users. Claude 4 and Opus 4 released - "world's best coding model." AI coding agents becoming mainstream in developer workflows.

A PM asked me last week if we should "re-estimate tickets after the AI writes them."

## The Misunderstanding

Story points were never meant to predict how long something takes.

They're a tool for conversation about:
- Complexity
- Risk
- Uncertainty

The teams using story points as time estimates are the same teams frustrated that AI "breaks" their velocity.

## What AI Revealed

[Content to be developed]

AI didn't break anything - it revealed that you were measuring the wrong thing all along.

If AI completing work faster "breaks" your metrics, your metrics were never measuring what you thought they were.

## The Contrarian Take

The best teams I've worked with stopped using story points years ago. Not because estimation is useless - because they found something that works better for them.
