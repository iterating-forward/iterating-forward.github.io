**Summary**: Platform engineering becomes the hottest trend in DevOps. But strip away the buzzwords, and it's just removing impediments - the thing Scrum Masters should have been doing all along.

**Tech Context (Jul 2025)**: Gartner predicts 80% of software engineering orgs will have platform teams by 2026. 55%+ already adopted platform engineering. Google reports 92% of CIOs planning AI integrations into platforms.

"We're building an Internal Developer Platform" is the new "We're doing Agile."

## The Core Insight

Platform engineering's core insight - that developers waste hours on tooling friction - is exactly what a Scrum Master should be escalating as an impediment.

High-maturity platform teams report 40-50% reductions in cognitive load for developers.

75% of developers lose over six hours weekly due to tool fragmentation.

## Why This Became a Separate Discipline

[Content to be developed]

The reason we needed a whole new discipline is because Scrum Masters weren't empowered to fix organizational problems.

Platform engineering succeeds where Scrum Masters fail: it has budget, authority, and executive backing.

## The Contrarian Take

Every impediment your team has about infrastructure, tooling, or deployment is a platform engineering problem. If you've been escalating these for years with no result, you understand why platform engineering needed to exist.
