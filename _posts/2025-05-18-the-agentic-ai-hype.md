**Summary**: "Agentic AI" becomes the hottest buzzword in tech. Everyone's talking about autonomous agents. Almost nobody's actually using them effectively.

**Tech Context (May 2025)**: Deloitte predicts 25% of companies will launch agentic AI pilots in 2025. Web Summit Vancouver focuses on AI agents. Capital One and other enterprises announce agentic AI initiatives.

Last month, someone asked if we could replace our Sprint Planning with an AI agent. I laughed. Then I thought about it.

## What Agentic AI Actually Is

Agentic AI is real - but it's not magic. Autonomous agents that can:

- Plan and execute multi-step tasks
- Self-correct when things go wrong
- Operate without constant human supervision

The key insight: AI agents amplify your existing organizational capability.

## The Prerequisite Nobody Mentions

[Content to be developed]

- Clear processes
- Well-defined workflows
- Actual team autonomy

If your Scrum team can't make decisions without three levels of approval, an AI agent won't fix that.

## The Contrarian Take

The companies hyping agentic AI the most are the ones least prepared to use it. Autonomy isn't something you add with software.
