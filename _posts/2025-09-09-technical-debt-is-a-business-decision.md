**Summary**: As AI generates more code faster, technical debt conversations intensify. But we've been framing this wrong all along.

**Tech Context (Sep 2025)**: Reports show 41%+ of code now AI-generated. Platform engineering focuses on reducing technical debt. "Shifting down" becomes the new "shifting left."

"We need to pay down technical debt" is developer-speak for "management made a decision I disagree with."

## Reframing the Conversation

Technical debt isn't a code problem - it's a business trade-off that was made, probably correctly, at the time.

The VP who shipped a feature with shortcuts was responding to:
- Market pressure
- Runway concerns
- Competitive threats

The debt isn't "bad" - it was a loan taken against future productivity.

## The Real Problem

[Content to be developed]

The problem isn't technical debt; it's technical debt without a repayment plan.

- Debt taken intentionally with a plan = strategic
- Debt accumulated accidentally = carelessness
- Debt ignored indefinitely = bankruptcy

## The Contrarian Take

Some technical debt should never be repaid. If the code works and nobody touches it, the "debt" costs nothing.
